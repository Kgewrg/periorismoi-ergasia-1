# periorismoi-ergasia-1
This is a repository for my school assignments involving constraint programming
It is mainly in greek so i don't know how usefull it's going to be for everybody.
I mainly use this repo so me and my team can work efficently on thin school project. 

If you willing to look more on the code and figure what it is doing you can find a python implementation of the AC3 algorithm to see if a sudoku puzzle has a solution.
